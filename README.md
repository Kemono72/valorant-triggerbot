# Valorant Triggerbot (Ethical Research Project)

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is for educational and ethical research purposes only. No part of this repository is intended to support or promote cheating in any game. All code has been redacted or modified to prevent replication of exploitative behavior.

## 📘 Overview

This project explored the use of real-time screen analysis and input simulation in the context of game interaction. It served as an experiment to understand:

- Windows API for keyboard and mouse simulation  
- Color-based detection via screen capture  
- Concepts behind real-time automation and its ethical boundaries  
- Responsible vulnerability disclosure (submitted to Riot Games)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Python scripting with `ctypes`, `Pillow`, and input libraries  
- Ethical exploration of game automation techniques  
- Generation of a vulnerability report with full disclosure steps and mitigation suggestions

## 📄 Files

- `pixelbot_redacted.py`: Demonstrates structure and techniques used (with critical sections removed).
